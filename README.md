# Gas-Station-Mini-Market-Improvement

## Introduction
Our supermarket, integrated into a gas station, is experiencing declining sales. This exercise aims to utilize Six Sigma methodologies to identify and address key factors contributing to the deviation from the desired sales target.

## Problem Statement
The average customer spends only 2 EUR at the gas station's supermarket, far below the desired average of 20 EUR. Management seeks to understand and rectify this deviation from the norm.

## Methodology
1. **Pareto Chart Creation**
   - Utilize Excel to analyze research data obtained from focus group events.
   - Identify key factors contributing to customer dissatisfaction.
   - Create a Pareto chart to prioritize issues based on their impact.

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identify root causes of the problem based on Pareto analysis.
   - Address primary issues such as inadequate product offerings and high prices, which collectively account for nearly 80% of dissatisfaction.

## Conclusion
By focusing on resolving key issues identified through Pareto analysis, such as improving product offerings and adjusting pricing strategies, the gas station's supermarket can significantly enhance customer satisfaction and potentially increase sales. It's essential to recognize that deeper root causes may exist, but addressing primary concerns is a crucial step in the improvement process.
